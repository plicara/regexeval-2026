# Working in Regex evaluation study

This repository owns its code, evidence, and lab context. Read `.plicara/README.md` and `.plicara/project.yaml` before substantive work. Use `make setup` and `make check`; the Makefile is authoritative for commands.

## Boundaries

Preserve committed predictions, measurement definitions, and generated-number checks. Reproduction is offline; collecting new predictions is a separate paid operation.

Work stays within the requested project. A sibling checkout is not an implicit dependency or an authorized edit target. Project lifecycle status lives only in `.plicara/project.yaml`; finishing ordinary work never requires updating a central lab board or organization profile.

## Tools and records

Use uv for Python: dependencies in the owning `pyproject.toml`, a committed lockfile, and `uv run --locked` for managed project commands. Independent experiments may have separate environments. Use the native locked package manager for other languages. Paid inference, long training, deployment, and publication are explicit operations outside routine checks.

Project procedures belong in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Add skills when a repeatable procedure exists; do not fill the folder with speculative instructions. Put significant decisions in dated, append-only records under `.plicara/decisions/`. Keep implementation docs beside code and link to them.

## Completion

Run the checks relevant to the change. Report failures, skipped checks, and remaining local changes accurately; a dirty working tree is not synchronized work. Preserve pre-existing edits. Update metadata only when its facts change, and never copy versions, test counts, or CI state into it.

Commit author: Adrian Tame <31286933+AdrianTJ@users.noreply.github.com>. Never add a co-author trailer or override the committer identity. Use conventional branch prefixes and short kebab-case names. Inspect staged changes for secrets before committing. Ask before destructive operations, publishing, or deployment.
